        <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
        <p>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder affecting people with ovaries, often during their reproductive years. The management of PCOS can involve a combination of medications and lifestyle changes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hormonal Birth Control:</strong> Helps regulate menstrual cycles and reduce symptoms like acne and excess hair growth. Options include pills, patches, or vaginal rings.</li>
            <li><strong>Metformin:</strong> Often prescribed to improve insulin sensitivity, which can help with weight management and ovulation. It may also lower blood sugar levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Anti-androgens:</strong> Medications like spironolactone can reduce hair loss and acne by blocking androgens, which are hormones that can cause these symptoms.</li>
            <li><strong>Fertility Medications:</strong> Clomiphene citrate or letrozole may be used for those trying to conceive, helping to induce ovulation.</li>
            <li><strong>Lifestyle Modifications:</strong> Essential for managing symptoms; weight loss can lead to improved insulin sensitivity and reduced symptoms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Dietary Recommendations</h2>
        <p>A balanced diet plays a crucial role in managing PCOS. Focus on the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Emphasize whole foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.</li>
            <li>Incorporate healthy fats from sources like avocados, nuts, and olive oil.</li>
            <li>Avoid refined sugars, processed foods, and high glycemic index carbohydrates to help manage insulin levels.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Consider consulting a registered dietitian for personalized dietary advice.</p>

        <h2>Exercise Tips</h2>
        <p>Regular physical activity is beneficial for managing weight and improving insulin sensitivity. Recommendations include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most days, such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming.</li>
            <li>Incorporate strength training exercises at least twice a week to build muscle and enhance metabolism.</li>
        </ul>

            <li><strong>Infertility:</strong> Irregular ovulation can make it difficult to conceive.</li>
            <li><strong>Metabolic Syndrome:</strong> Increased risk of high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and abnormal cholesterol levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Type 2 Diabetes:</strong> Insulin resistance can lead to diabetes.</li>
            <li><strong>Endometrial Cancer:</strong> Irregular menstruation can increase the risk of uterine cancer.</li>
        </ul>
